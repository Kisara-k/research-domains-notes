## Key Points

#### 1. 🧬 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)  
- PCR exponentially amplifies DNA by doubling the amount of target DNA each cycle.  
- PCR requires template DNA, primers (15-20 bases long), DNA polymerase, and nucleotides (A, C, G, T).  
- PCR cycles include denaturation (~94°C), annealing (~54°C), and extension (~72°C).  
- DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA strands starting from primers during the extension step.  
- After ~30 cycles, PCR can produce over a billion copies from a single DNA molecule.

- Each nucleotide fluoresces a unique color, allowing base identification by imaging after each cycle.  
- Terminator modifications prevent addition of more than one base per cycle and are chemically reversible.  
- Errors increase in later cycles due to some DNA fragments falling behind or jumping ahead during base addition.  
- NGS output consists of “reads” with base calls and quality scores estimating error likelihood.  

#### 3. 🧩 Exome Sequencing

## Study Notes

### 1. 🧬 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): Copying DNA Efficiently

#### Introduction to PCR  
Polymerase Chain Reaction, or PCR, is a groundbreaking technique that allows scientists to make millions or even billions of copies of a specific DNA segment quickly and efficiently. Imagine having a tiny snippet of DNA and wanting to create enough copies to study it in detail—PCR is the tool that makes this possible. This is essential because many DNA analysis methods, like sequencing, require large amounts of identical DNA molecules to work properly.

#### How PCR Works: The Basics  
PCR exploits two fundamental properties of DNA:

- **DNA is double-stranded:** DNA consists of two complementary strands that stick together through base pairing (A pairs with T, and C pairs with G).
- **DNA strands have directionality:** Each strand has a 5’ (five prime) end and a 3’ (three prime) end, which is important for how enzymes interact with DNA.

#### Key Components of PCR  
- **Template DNA:** The original DNA you want to copy.
- **Primers:** Short single-stranded DNA sequences (usually 15-20 bases long) that are complementary to the start and end of the target DNA region. They “prime” the copying process by binding to the template DNA.
- **DNA Polymerase:** An enzyme that synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides (A, C, G, T) complementary to the template strand.
- **Nucleotides (dNTPs):** The building blocks (A, C, G, T) that DNA polymerase uses to build new DNA strands.

#### The PCR Cycle: Step-by-Step  
PCR involves repeating three main temperature-controlled steps in cycles:

1. **Denaturation (around 94°C):** Heating the mixture causes the double-stranded DNA to “melt” or separate into single strands.
2. **Annealing (around 54°C):** Cooling the mixture allows primers to bind (anneal) to their complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA. Primers bind faster than the DNA strands can re-anneal because they are shorter and more mobile.
3. **Extension (around 72°C):** DNA polymerase extends the primers by adding nucleotides, synthesizing new complementary strands.

After one cycle, the amount of target DNA doubles. Repeating this cycle 30 times can theoretically produce over a billion copies from a single DNA molecule, which is why PCR is called a **chain reaction**—each new copy serves as a template for the next round.

#### Why PCR is Revolutionary  
PCR is simple, automatic, and incredibly powerful. It uses the natural properties of DNA and DNA polymerase to exponentially amplify DNA without needing complex machinery. This technique revolutionized molecular biology and earned Kary Mullis the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.


### 2. 🔬 Next Generation Sequencing (NGS): Reading DNA at Scale

#### Introduction to NGS  
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) refers to modern DNA sequencing technologies developed since around 2007. These methods allow scientists to sequence millions of DNA fragments simultaneously, making DNA sequencing faster, cheaper, and more accessible than ever before.

#### Historical Context  
- **First Generation:** Sanger sequencing (1970s-1990s) was the original method, slow and manual but highly accurate.
- **Second Generation (NGS):** Automated, massively parallel sequencing of millions of DNA fragments.
- **Emerging Third Generation:** Single-molecule sequencing technologies (still developing).

#### How NGS Works: The Core Idea  
NGS relies on copying DNA fragments and detecting which bases are added during synthesis. The process involves:

1. **Fragmenting DNA:** The DNA to be sequenced is chopped into small pieces (hundreds to about 1,000 bases long).
2. **Attaching DNA to a slide:** Millions of these fragments are chemically attached to a solid surface (a slide).
3. **Amplifying fragments:** PCR is used directly on the slide to create clusters of identical DNA fragments, increasing the signal for detection.
4. **Sequencing by synthesis:** Special nucleotides labeled with fluorescent dyes and reversible terminators are added. Each base (A, C, G, T) fluoresces a different color when excited by a laser.
5. **Imaging:** After adding one base per cycle, a camera captures the fluorescence at each cluster, revealing which base was incorporated.
6. **Repeating cycles:** The terminator is chemically removed, allowing the next base to be added and imaged. This cycle repeats to read the sequence base-by-base.

#### Important Features of NGS  
- **Parallel sequencing:** Millions of DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously.
- **Fluorescent labeling:** Each base emits a unique color, allowing base identification.
- **Reversible terminators:** Ensure only one base is added per cycle, preventing errors from multiple incorporations.
- **Error sources:** Errors increase in later cycles because some DNA fragments in a cluster may “fall behind” or “jump ahead” due to imperfect base addition, causing signal noise.

#### Output of NGS  
The result is a collection of “reads,” which are sequences of bases (A, C, G, T) with associated quality scores indicating the confidence in each base call. These reads are then computationally assembled and analyzed.


### 3. 🧩 Applications of Next Generation Sequencing

#### Introduction to NGS Applications  
The speed and affordability of NGS have opened up many new ways to study DNA and RNA, allowing scientists to ask and answer questions that were previously too difficult or expensive to tackle.

#### Exome Sequencing  
- **What is the exome?** The exome is the part of the genome that codes for proteins, made up of all the exons (the coding regions of genes).
- **Why sequence the exome?** Although the exome is only about 1.5% of the genome, it contains most mutations that affect protein function and cause disease.
- **How is it done?** DNA is fragmented, and exonic fragments are captured using probes attached to magnetic beads that bind only to exon sequences. These captured fragments are then sequenced.
- **Benefit:** Sequencing only the exome reduces cost and data complexity while focusing on the most functionally important parts of the genome.

#### RNA Sequencing (RNA-seq)  
- **Purpose:** To measure gene expression by sequencing RNA molecules present in a cell or tissue.
- **Key feature:** Mature messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules have a poly-A tail (a long string of adenine bases).
- **Method:** Use a string of T bases attached to beads to capture mRNA by binding to the poly-A tail. Then, reverse transcriptase converts RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), which can be sequenced.
- **Outcome:** RNA-seq reveals which genes are active and at what levels, providing insights into cellular function and response.

#### ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing)  
- **Goal:** To find where specific proteins bind on the DNA.
- **Why important?** Proteins called transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to DNA near genes.
- **Method:**  
  1. Cross-link proteins to DNA to “freeze” their binding locations.
  2. Fragment the DNA.
  3. Use antibodies to pull out the protein-DNA complexes.
  4. Remove proteins and sequence the attached DNA fragments.
- **Result:** Identifies DNA regions bound by specific proteins, helping understand gene regulation.

#### Bisulfite Sequencing (Methyl-Seq)  
- **Purpose:** To detect DNA methylation, an epigenetic modification affecting gene expression.
- **Methylation:** Methyl groups attach only to cytosine (C) bases.
- **Method:**  
  1. Split DNA into two samples.
  2. Treat one sample with bisulfite, which converts unmethylated cytosines to uracils (U), but leaves methylated cytosines unchanged.
  3. Sequence both samples.
  4. Compare sequences to identify methylated sites.
- **Challenge:** Bisulfite treatment changes the DNA sequence, so specialized software is needed to align and interpret the data.
- **Significance:** Reveals epigenetic patterns that influence gene activity and can be inherited through cell division.


### Summary
