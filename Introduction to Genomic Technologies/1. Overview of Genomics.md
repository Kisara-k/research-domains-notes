## Study Notes

### 1. 🧬 What is Genomics? An Overview

Genomics is the study of genomes, which are the complete set of DNA inside an organism’s cells. When we talk about human genomics, we mean studying the entire human genome — all the DNA that governs how our bodies develop, function, and differ from one another. Even though humans look very different, our genomes are astonishingly similar — about 99.9% identical. This tiny 0.1% difference is responsible for all the diversity we see: why some people are tall, others short; why some live longer; why some get diseases like cancer and others don’t.

Our genome is like a biological instruction manual. It starts from a single cell (the fertilized egg) and guides the development of a whole person, determining how cells specialize into different types — like neurons in the brain or skin cells — even though every cell contains the same DNA. Understanding how the same genome can produce such different cell types is a major question in genomics.

Cancer is a key area of genomics research. Cancer is essentially a genetic disease where cells lose control over their division and start growing uncontrollably. This happens because of mutations — changes in the DNA sequence — that affect genes controlling cell division. Mutations can occur due to DNA damage or errors during DNA replication, which happens every time a cell divides. Although cells are very good at copying DNA accurately, occasional mistakes happen, and some of these can lead to cancer.

The fundamental process connecting DNA to the functioning of cells is called the **central dogma of molecular biology**. It describes how information flows from DNA to RNA to proteins. DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins. Proteins perform most of the work in cells, from metabolism to structural roles. However, this flow of information is not one-way; proteins and other factors can influence which genes are turned on or off, creating feedback loops that regulate cell behavior.

To study genomics, scientists use **sequencing technology** to read the DNA letters (A, C, G, T). Sequencing has become incredibly fast and cheap over the past 20 years, enabling researchers to sequence entire genomes quickly and at low cost. This revolution has made it possible to study cancer genomes, population genetics, and many other areas in unprecedented detail.


### 2. 🧫 Basics of Cell Biology Relevant to Genomics

To understand genomics, it’s important to know some basic cell biology. All living organisms are divided into three domains: **eukaryotes**, **archaea**, and **bacteria**. Eukaryotes (which include humans, plants, and yeast) have cells with a nucleus — a special compartment that holds the DNA. Prokaryotes (archaea and bacteria) do not have a nucleus; their DNA floats more freely inside the cell.

In eukaryotic cells, DNA is tightly packed inside the nucleus in structures called **chromosomes**. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes — one set from each parent. Each chromosome is a very long DNA molecule, and the entire human genome is about 3 billion base pairs long.

Cells divide through a process called **mitosis**, where DNA is replicated so that each daughter cell gets a complete copy of the genome. Humans are **diploid**, meaning we have two copies of each chromosome (one from mom, one from dad). During sexual reproduction, a special type of cell division called **meiosis** occurs, which produces sperm and egg cells with only one copy of each chromosome. Meiosis also involves **recombination**, where chromosomes from mom and dad exchange pieces, creating new combinations of genes. This recombination is a major source of genetic diversity in populations.


### 3. 🧪 Key Molecules in Molecular Biology: DNA, RNA, and Proteins

The three most important molecules in genomics are **DNA**, **RNA**, and **proteins**.

- **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)** is the molecule that stores genetic information. It is made of four nucleotides: Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C), and Thymine (T). A pairs with T, and G pairs with C, forming the famous double helix structure. This complementary pairing allows DNA to be copied accurately during cell division.

- **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)** is similar to DNA but usually single-stranded and uses Uracil (U) instead of Thymine. RNA is made by copying DNA in a process called **transcription**. Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic code from DNA to the cell’s protein-making machinery.

- **Proteins** are long chains of amino acids (20 standard types) that perform most cellular functions. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in RNA, read in groups of three called **codons**. Each codon corresponds to one amino acid or a stop signal. This process is called **translation**.

DNA → RNA → Protein is the central flow of genetic information, but proteins can also regulate DNA activity, creating complex feedback systems.


### 4. 🧬 The Human Genome Project: History and Impact

The **Human Genome Project (HGP)** was a massive international effort started in 1989 to sequence the entire human genome. Initially proposed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), it was later joined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and international partners. The goal was to sequence all 3 billion base pairs of human DNA within 15 years and at a cost of about $3 billion.

Early sequencing technology was slow and expensive, so the project developed strategies to break the genome into manageable pieces called **bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs)**, sequence those, and then assemble the full genome.

In 1995, a breakthrough came when the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) sequenced the first complete bacterial genome using a method called **whole genome shotgun sequencing**, which skips mapping and sequences many small fragments randomly, then assembles them computationally.

In 1998, a private company called **Celera Genomics** entered the race to sequence the human genome using this shotgun method, accelerating the public project. Both groups announced draft human genomes in 2000, and the final draft was published in 2001.

The HGP revealed that humans have far fewer genes than expected — about 20,000 to 23,000 protein-coding genes, much less than earlier estimates of 100,000 or even millions. It also showed that only about 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins, with the rest having regulatory or unknown functions.

The project dramatically lowered the cost and time required for sequencing, paving the way for modern genomics research.


### 5. 🧩 Molecular Structures in Genomics: DNA Packaging, Repeats, and RNA Processing

DNA is extremely long — about 2 meters per cell — but fits inside the tiny nucleus because it is tightly packed. DNA wraps around proteins called **histones**, forming a "beads on a string" structure, which coils further into chromosomes.

Within the genome, there are many **repetitive sequences**:

- **Tandem repeats**: identical sequences repeated one after another.
- **Interspersed repeats**: similar sequences scattered throughout the genome.

Repeats can complicate DNA sequencing and analysis because short reads from sequencing machines may match multiple places in the genome.

Genes in eukaryotes are often interrupted by **introns** (non-coding regions) that are removed during RNA processing, leaving only **exons** (coding regions) to be translated into protein. This process is called **splicing**. A gene can produce multiple proteins through **alternative splicing**, where different combinations of exons are joined together.


### 6. 🧩 Protein Structure and Gene Regulation

Proteins are not just simple chains of amino acids; they fold into complex 3D shapes that determine their function. Two common secondary structures are **alpha helices** and **beta sheets**.

Gene expression is tightly controlled by **transcription factors**, which are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences near genes and regulate whether those genes are turned on or off. This regulation allows different cell types to express different sets of genes, even though they have the same DNA.

Another layer of control is **epigenetics**, which involves chemical modifications to DNA or histones that affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence. One common epigenetic mark is **DNA methylation**, where methyl groups are added to DNA and can be inherited through cell division, influencing which genes are active.


### 7. 🧬 From Genotype to Phenotype: Understanding Genetic Variation and Traits

Your **genotype** is the complete set of genetic information you carry — all your DNA sequences and mutations. Your **phenotype** is the observable traits, like eye color, height, or disease status.

Some traits follow simple genetic rules, like Mendel’s pea experiments, where traits can be **dominant** or **recessive**. For example, yellow pea color is dominant over green. If a pea inherits one yellow gene, it will be yellow; it must inherit two green genes to be green.

In humans, many traits are more complex and influenced by multiple genes and environmental factors. Large-scale sequencing projects have mapped genetic variation across populations, showing that people from different regions have characteristic patterns of mutations.

Scientists use **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)** to find links between specific genetic variants (like single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and traits or diseases. These studies compare the frequency of variants in people with a trait (cases) versus those without (controls) to identify genetic factors that increase risk or influence traits.

For example, a variant in the gene **HERC2** is strongly associated with eye color in Europeans, where certain genotypes increase the likelihood of blue or brown eyes.


### 8. 💻 Genomic Data Science: How We Study Genomes Today

Genomic data science combines biology, statistics, and computer science to analyze the massive amounts of data generated by sequencing.

The typical workflow includes:

- **Experimental design**: deciding what question to ask, how many samples to collect, and what type of sequencing to perform.
- **Data generation**: sequencing DNA or RNA from samples, producing millions or billions of short sequence reads.
- **Data processing**: aligning reads to a reference genome to identify differences and assemble sequences.
- **Preprocessing and normalization**: correcting for biases and errors in the data to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Statistical and computational analysis**: using machine learning, statistical models, and software tools to interpret the data and draw biological conclusions.

Software development is a key part of genomic data science, creating tools that can handle standardized experiments like RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which measures gene expression levels.

Beyond individual genomes, **population genomics** studies genetic variation across groups to understand disease susceptibility and evolutionary history. **Integrative genomics** or **systems biology** combines multiple data types (DNA, RNA, proteins) to get a comprehensive view of biological systems.


### Summary

Genomics is a powerful field that studies the complete genetic material of organisms to understand biology, disease, and diversity. Advances in sequencing technology and computational methods have transformed genomics into a data-rich science, enabling discoveries about how DNA shapes life from molecules to populations. Understanding the basics of DNA, RNA, proteins, cell biology, and data analysis is essential to grasp the exciting potential of genomics today.
