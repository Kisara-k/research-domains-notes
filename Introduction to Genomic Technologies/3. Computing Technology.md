## Study Notes

### 1. 💻 What is Computer Science? Understanding the Big Picture

Computer Science is a broad field that involves many different activities related to computers and computation. To make sense of this diversity, computer science is often divided into three main categories:

- **Theory:** This area focuses on the fundamental questions about what computers can do. It studies the kinds of problems that can be solved by computers and how efficiently they can be solved. Theory is about understanding the limits and capabilities of computation itself.

- **Systems:** This area deals with the actual computers and the software that runs on them. It includes building operating systems (the software that manages the computer’s hardware and resources), designing programming languages (the languages we use to write software), and managing how programs run on computers, especially in complex environments like multiprocessor systems.

- **Applications:** This is the broadest category and involves using computers to solve real-world problems. Applications can be in science, business, medicine, and many other fields. As computer science has matured, many applications have become specialized and sometimes are considered separate fields.

#### Thinking Computationally

A key skill in computer science is **computational thinking**. This means approaching problems by breaking them down into precise, step-by-step tasks that a computer can perform. Unlike human communication, computers do exactly what they are told—no more, no less—so instructions must be very clear and unambiguous. Computational thinking is not just about programming; it’s about understanding how to translate a problem into a form that a computer can handle.


### 2. 🖥️ Systems in Computer Science: Operating Systems and Programming Languages

#### Operating Systems

Operating systems (OS) are the foundational software that manage a computer’s hardware and provide services for other software. For example, if you are using a Mac, underneath it runs an OS called **UNIX**, which is one of the oldest and most stable operating systems, existing for over 30 years.

The OS handles many critical tasks:

- Moving data between storage devices (like hard drives) and the computer’s fast internal memory (RAM).
- Loading and running programs.
- Managing input/output devices like screens and printers.
- Handling multiple processors and allowing multiple programs to run simultaneously without crashing.

#### Programming Languages

Programming languages are how we communicate instructions to computers. Unlike natural languages (like English), programming languages are very strict and precise. Each word or symbol has a specific meaning, and the computer executes exactly what the code says.

There are many programming languages, each with different strengths. Some popular ones today include:

- **Python:** Known for simplicity and readability.
- **Perl:** Often used for text processing.
- **C++ and Java:** Used for more complex, performance-critical applications.

Learning a programming language is learning how to give precise instructions to a computer.

#### Software Engineering

Writing code is not just about making it work once. **Software engineering** is the discipline of writing code that is reliable, maintainable, and tested thoroughly. Good software engineering involves:

- Testing code to ensure it works in all expected cases.
- Handling unexpected or rare cases gracefully (e.g., avoiding crashes).
- Making sure the program behaves robustly and efficiently.

For example, a program should never crash or freeze your computer, even if it encounters unusual input.

#### Hardware and Devices

Beyond software, computer science also involves understanding the **hardware**—the physical devices that run software. Today, computers are everywhere, from laptops and desktops to mobile phones and robots. Many devices are controlled by embedded computers, and understanding how software interacts with hardware is an important part of computer science.


### 3. 🔍 Algorithms: Step-by-Step Instructions for Solving Problems

An **algorithm** is a clear, step-by-step set of instructions for accomplishing a task. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science because they describe what a computer can do.

#### Algorithms Don’t Need Computers

Interestingly, algorithms exist independently of computers. For example, a recipe for making brownies is an algorithm: it tells you exactly what steps to follow to get the final product. As long as you understand the instructions, you can follow the algorithm.

#### Example: Finding a Maximum

Imagine you want to find the highest point in a landscape. One simple algorithm is:

- Look around and find the direction where the slope is steepest uphill.
- Take a step in that direction.
- Repeat until you can no longer go uphill.

This algorithm will find the nearest peak, but not necessarily the highest peak overall. This illustrates that some algorithms find local optima rather than global optima.

#### Example: Sorting

Sorting is a common problem where you want to arrange items in order (e.g., numbers from smallest to largest).

One simple sorting algorithm is **bubble sort**:

- Start at the beginning of the list.
- Compare each pair of adjacent items.
- If they are in the wrong order, swap them.
- Repeat this process, going back to the start each time, until the entire list is sorted.

Bubble sort always works but is inefficient for large lists because it makes many passes through the data. This introduces the idea of **algorithmic efficiency**—some algorithms solve problems faster or with less resource use than others.


### 4. 🗃️ Data Structures and Memory: Organizing and Storing Data Efficiently

Data structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. This is especially important when dealing with very large datasets, such as genomic sequences.

#### Storing Genomic Data

Genomic data often comes as long strings of letters (A, C, G, T) representing DNA sequences. Computers store text as bytes, where each character typically takes one byte (8 bits).

However, DNA only has four letters, so we can store each letter using just 2 bits instead of 8, achieving a **fourfold compression**. For example:

- A = 00
- C = 01
- G = 10
- T = 11

This compression is crucial when storing gigabytes or terabytes of DNA data.

#### Common Data Structures

- **Lists:** Simple sequences of items.
- **Linked lists:** Lists where each item points to the next, allowing efficient insertion and deletion.
- **Trees:** Hierarchical structures where each item can point to multiple others, useful for organizing data with relationships.

#### Pointers and Memory Addresses

In computer memory, every piece of data has an **address**. A **pointer** is a variable that stores the address of another piece of data. Using pointers, data structures can link related pieces of data together, enabling quick navigation through large datasets.

#### Representing Biological Patterns

Sometimes, instead of storing every sequence explicitly, we store patterns or probabilistic models. For example, introns (non-coding regions in genes) have characteristic start and end sequences (GT at the start, AG at the end). By analyzing many introns, we can create a **probabilistic model** showing the likelihood of each nucleotide at each position, compressing the information and helping us recognize these patterns in new data.


### 5. ⚡ Algorithmic Efficiency: Why Speed and Resource Use Matter

Efficiency is about how fast and how resourcefully an algorithm solves a problem, especially important when working with big data like genomics.

#### Example: Mail Delivery Problem

Imagine a mail truck delivering mail:

- A simple algorithm: pick up mail for one house, deliver it, return to warehouse, repeat for each house.
- This works but is inefficient because the truck travels back and forth unnecessarily.

A better algorithm would:

- Load mail for many houses at once.
- Deliver mail to houses in a route that minimizes travel distance.
- Return to warehouse only when the truck is empty.

This is related to the **Traveling Salesman Problem**, a classic problem in computer science about finding the shortest possible route visiting a set of locations.

#### Why Efficiency Matters

When algorithms are inefficient, they waste time and resources. With large datasets, inefficient algorithms can become impractical. Therefore, computer scientists strive to design algorithms that solve problems correctly **and** efficiently.


### 6. 🛠️ Software Engineering in Genomic Data Science: Writing Reliable Code

Software engineering is the practice of writing code that is not only functional but also reliable, maintainable, and robust.

#### Handling Edge Cases

Programs must handle all possible inputs, including rare or unexpected cases. For example, in a program that divides two numbers, you must check that the denominator is not zero to avoid crashes.

#### Importance in Genomics

Genomic datasets are huge and complex, so software must be carefully engineered to handle all cases without crashing or producing misleading results.

#### Example: RNA Editing and Software Reliability

RNA editing is a biological process where some RNA nucleotides are changed after transcription. Detecting RNA editing involves aligning RNA sequences to DNA sequences and looking for differences.

- Some researchers found thousands of new RNA editing sites using alignment software.
- However, many of these differences were due to software errors or misalignments.
- This shows that even well-engineered software can produce errors on big datasets.
- It’s critical to understand how software works and to verify results carefully.


### 7. 🧬 Computational Biology Software: From Raw Data to Biological Insights

Computational biology software transforms raw biological data into meaningful information.

#### Raw Data to Information

Raw data from genome sequencing is just long strings of letters (A, C, G, T) that are hard to interpret. Software pipelines process this data through multiple steps to produce results that biologists can understand and use.

#### Analysis Pipelines

A **pipeline** is a series of software tools that process data step-by-step. For example, in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq):

- **Bowtie:** Aligns short RNA reads to the genome.
- **TopHat:** Handles reads that span splice junctions (where RNA is cut and rejoined).
- **Cufflinks:** Assembles aligned reads into genes and estimates gene expression levels.
- **Cuffdiff:** Compares gene expression between samples.

These tools together convert raw RNA sequence data into a list of genes and their expression levels, which can be used to study biological differences.

#### Keeping Up with Software

Software tools evolve rapidly. Newer versions (e.g., Bowtie2, HISAT, StringTie, Ballgown) improve speed and accuracy. Different tools can produce different results, so computational biologists must stay informed about the latest software and understand their strengths and limitations.


### 8. 🔄 The Changing Landscape: Technology and Software Evolution

Sequencing technology and computational biology software are both advancing quickly:

- New sequencing machines produce longer and more complex reads.
- Software must adapt to handle new data types and larger volumes.
- Using outdated software on new data can lead to incorrect results.
- Continuous learning and updating software tools are essential for accurate analysis.


### Summary

Computer science is a vast field encompassing theory, systems, and applications. Computational thinking is essential for solving problems with computers. Systems include operating systems and programming languages, while software engineering ensures code reliability. Algorithms are step-by-step instructions, and their efficiency is crucial for handling big data. Data structures organize data efficiently, especially in genomics where compression and pattern recognition are important. Computational biology software pipelines transform raw sequencing data into meaningful biological insights, but software must be carefully engineered and constantly updated to keep pace with evolving technology.
