## Key Points

#### 1. 📊 Importance of Statistics in Genomic Data Science  
- Genomic data science combines biology, computer science, and statistics; statistics is often undervalued but critical.  
- A high-profile study claiming genomic data could predict chemotherapy response failed due to poor statistical analysis and lack of reproducibility.  
- Lack of statistical rigor in genomic studies can lead to clinical trial errors and lawsuits.  
- The Institute of Medicine issued new standards focusing heavily on statistical reproducibility and model validation.

#### 2. 🔍 Transparency and Reproducibility  
- Raw data and code must be shared to allow independent reproduction of analyses.  
- Lack of cooperation and data/code sharing delays detection of errors in studies.  
- Statistical expertise is necessary to avoid flawed prediction models and study design errors.  
- Prediction models must be “locked down” to avoid random variability in results.

#### 3. 🎯 Central Dogma of Statistics  
- Statistical inference uses a probability-based sample to estimate characteristics of a larger population.  
- Sampling variability means estimates from samples have uncertainty that must be quantified.  
- Changes in the population after sampling (population drift) can invalidate inference.  
- Example: Google Flu Trends failed because the population (search behavior) changed over time.

#### 4. 📂 Components of a Complete Data Set for Sharing  
- Raw data: unprocessed data directly from experiments (e.g., FASTQ files).  
- Tidy data: cleaned, organized data with one variable per column and one observation per row.  
- Code book: detailed descriptions of variables, including units and meanings.  
- Recipe: exact, reproducible instructions or scripts to transform raw data into tidy data.

#### 5. 🤝 Getting Statistical Help  
- Learning statistics through courses and online resources is recommended.  
- Q&A sites like Cross Validated and Stack Overflow are useful for specific questions.  
- Hiring a “lonely bioinformatician” is challenging due to lack of support.  
- Long-term collaborations with computational biology or biostatistics centers provide the best expertise.

#### 6. 📈 Interactive Data Analysis and Visualization  
- Interactive analysis with plots helps detect data issues and patterns missed by summary statistics.  
- Plots should show raw data points, not just summary statistics like bar plots with confidence intervals.  
- Replicate comparisons (scatter plots, log transforms, MA plots) assess measurement reliability.  
- Avoid “ridiculograms” — visually complex but scientifically uninformative network plots.

#### 7. 📐 Experimental Design, Sample Size, and Variability  
- Sample size affects power, the probability of detecting a true effect.  
- Variability arises from phenotypic differences, measurement error, and natural biological variation.  
- Power calculations depend on effect size, variability, and sample size; 80% power is a common target.  
- Balanced designs, technical and biological replicates, and controls improve study reliability.

#### 8. ❓ Statistical Significance and P-values  
- The t-statistic measures difference between group means scaled by variability.  
- P-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.  
- P-values are often misinterpreted; they are not the probability that the null or alternative hypothesis is true.  
- The conventional cutoff of 0.05 for significance is arbitrary and historically derived.

#### 9. 🔢 Multiple Testing and Error Rates  
- P-values are uniformly distributed under the null hypothesis, so multiple tests increase false positives.  
- Family Wise Error Rate (FWER) controls the probability of any false positives; very strict.  
- False Discovery Rate (FDR) controls the expected proportion of false positives among discoveries; more liberal.  
- Different error controls lead to different interpretations of “statistical significance.”

#### 10. ⚠️ Avoiding P-value Hacking and Reporting Negative Results  
- P-value hacking involves manipulating data or analysis to produce significant results.  
- Pre-specifying and adhering to an analysis plan helps prevent p-hacking.  
- Reporting negative results is important to avoid publication bias.

#### 11. 🔄 Confounding and Batch Effects  
- A confounder is a variable related to both the predictor and outcome, potentially causing false associations.  
- Batch effects are common confounders in genomics, e.g., samples processed on different days showing artificial differences.  
- Randomization breaks associations between confounders and treatments.  
- Stratification balances confounders across groups to allow independent effect estimation.  
- Poor design without randomization or stratification can lead to irreproducible or false findings.

## Study Notes

### 1. 📊 Why Statistics Matters in Genomic Data Science

Genomic data science is a multidisciplinary field combining **biology**, **computer science**, and **statistics**. While biology and computer science often get the spotlight, statistics is just as crucial—yet sometimes overlooked. This lecture highlights why statistics is essential for making sense of genomic data and ensuring reliable scientific conclusions.

A famous example illustrates this importance: a high-profile study published in *Nature Medicine* claimed that genomic data could predict which chemotherapy treatments would work best for individual cancer patients. This was hailed as a breakthrough in personalized medicine. However, when researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center tried to reproduce the results, they encountered serious problems. The original data and code were not fully available, and the analysis was flawed. This led to a scandal involving clinical trials based on incorrect statistical analysis, lawsuits, and a major report from the Institute of Medicine emphasizing new standards for genomic data science—especially around **statistical rigor and reproducibility**.

This story shows that ignoring statistics or treating it as an afterthought can have real-world consequences, including patient harm and loss of trust in science. It also highlights the need for transparency, cooperation, and statistical expertise in genomic research.


### 2. 🔍 Transparency, Reproducibility, and Statistical Expertise

Two main reasons the chemotherapy prediction study failed were:

- **Lack of transparency:** The original researchers did not share raw data or code, making it impossible for others to reproduce the analysis. Reproducibility means that independent researchers can run the same analysis and get the same results. Without access to data and code, this is impossible.

- **Lack of statistical expertise:** The prediction models used were based on incorrect and even nonsensical probability formulas. The researchers lacked proper training in statistics, leading to flawed study design and unreliable predictions.

Other problems included **study design flaws** such as confounding variables (e.g., samples run on different days linked to outcomes) and **unstable prediction rules** that gave different results when run on different days.

Eventually, statisticians at MD Anderson reconstructed the entire analysis, making it reproducible—but the original conclusions were simply wrong due to poor statistical methods.

This example underscores the importance of involving statisticians early in the research process, from experimental design to data analysis.


### 3. 🎯 The Central Dogma of Statistics: Sampling and Inference

Just like biology has a central dogma, statistics has a core idea that guides how we learn about populations from data:

- **Population:** The entire group you want to understand (e.g., all cancer patients).
- **Sample:** A smaller subset of the population that you actually measure, chosen using probability methods to represent the population fairly.
- **Statistical inference:** Using the sample data to make educated guesses about the whole population, including quantifying uncertainty.

Because measuring the entire population is often impossible or too expensive, we rely on samples. But samples are imperfect—they vary due to chance. Statistical inference helps us estimate not only the population parameters (like average gene expression) but also how confident we are in those estimates.

A key challenge is that the population itself can change over time. For example, Google Flu Trends initially predicted flu outbreaks well using search data, but as people's search behavior changed, the model became inaccurate. This shows the importance of understanding what the population really is and how it may evolve.


### 4. 📂 Data Sharing: Raw Data, Tidy Data, Code Books, and Recipes

For genomic data science to be reproducible and trustworthy, sharing data properly is essential. A complete data set for sharing includes four components:

1. **Raw data:** The unprocessed data directly from the experiment or sequencing machine (e.g., FASTQ files with sequencing reads). This is the "rawest" form of data available to you.

2. **Tidy data:** A cleaned and organized version of the data where each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each data set is a single table. For example, genomic measurements in one table and phenotype data in another, linked by a common identifier.

3. **Code book:** A detailed description of each variable in the tidy data, including units and meanings. This prevents confusion (e.g., whether height is measured in feet or meters).

4. **Recipe:** A precise, reproducible set of instructions or scripts (usually in R or Python) that transform raw data into tidy data. This should be executable without manual intervention to ensure reproducibility.

If scripts are not available, a very detailed manual recipe must be provided, including software versions and parameters, but this is error-prone and discouraged.


### 5. 🤝 Getting Help with Statistics: Learning, Q&A, and Collaboration

Statistics can be challenging, but there are many ways to get help:

- **Learn statistics yourself:** There are many online courses, including the one in this specialization and others from Johns Hopkins and elsewhere.

- **Ask questions on Q&A sites:** Websites like Cross Validated and Stack Overflow are great for specific questions about statistical methods or software.

- **Hire a bioinformatician:** Some labs hire a "lonely bioinformatician" who works alone on computational biology. This can be difficult due to lack of support.

- **Form collaborations:** The best approach is often to collaborate with a center or group specializing in computational biology or biostatistics. These centers have teams with deep expertise and resources to help with complex analyses.


### 6. 📈 Interactive Data Analysis and Visualization

Statistical analysis of genomic data should be **interactive** and heavily rely on **visualization**. The goal is to reduce large, complex data sets into manageable summaries that reveal patterns and potential issues.

- **Plot early and often:** Visualizing data helps detect outliers, batch effects, or unexpected patterns that summary statistics might miss.

- **Show raw data in plots:** Avoid bar plots that only show means and confidence intervals without the underlying data points. Showing individual data points helps assess variability and sample size.

- **Plot replicates:** Comparing technical replicates (same sample measured twice) helps assess measurement reliability. Use scatter plots, log transforms, or Bland-Altman (MA) plots to visualize agreement.

- **Beware of "ridiculograms":** These are complex, visually impressive network plots that look nice but convey little meaningful information. Good plots should be both attractive and informative.


### 7. 📐 Experimental Design, Sample Size, and Variability

Good experimental design is critical to obtaining reliable results. Key concepts include:

- **Sample size:** The number of samples you collect affects your ability to detect true effects. More samples generally increase **power**, the probability of detecting a real effect.

- **Variability:** Differences in measurements come from three sources:
  - **Phenotypic variability:** Differences between groups (e.g., cancer vs. control).
  - **Measurement error:** Noise introduced by the technology or assay.
  - **Biological variability:** Natural differences between individuals, even if they share the same phenotype.

- **Power calculations:** Before starting a study, calculate how many samples you need to detect an effect of a given size with acceptable confidence (often 80% power). Power depends on effect size, variability, and sample size.

- **Balanced design and replication:** Experiments should have roughly equal numbers of treated and control samples, include technical replicates (same sample repeated) and biological replicates (different individuals), and include positive and negative controls.


### 8. ❓ Understanding Statistical Significance and P-values

Statistical significance helps decide whether observed differences are likely to be real or due to chance.

- The **t-statistic** measures the difference between group means scaled by variability. Larger t-values suggest stronger evidence of a difference.

- The **p-value** is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one calculated, assuming no real difference (null hypothesis). A small p-value (commonly <0.05) suggests the observed difference is unlikely due to chance.

- **Important clarifications about p-values:**
  - A p-value is **not** the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
  - It is **not** the probability that the alternative hypothesis is true.
  - It is **not** a direct measure of evidence strength.
  
Misinterpretation of p-values is common and can lead to false conclusions.


### 9. 🔢 Multiple Testing and Error Rates

In genomic studies, thousands of tests are performed simultaneously (e.g., testing every gene for differential expression). This creates a multiple testing problem:

- When many tests are done, some will appear significant by chance alone (false positives).

- **P-values under the null hypothesis are uniformly distributed**, meaning about 5% will be below 0.05 even if no real effect exists.

- To address this, we control error rates:

  - **Family Wise Error Rate (FWER):** Probability of making even one false positive. Very strict, reduces false positives but may miss true positives.

  - **False Discovery Rate (FDR):** Expected proportion of false positives among all discoveries. More liberal, allows more discoveries but accepts some false positives.

- Interpretation differs: FDR control means you accept some false positives but know their proportion; FWER control means you want to avoid any false positives.

- Example: Out of 10,000 genes, 550 might be significant at p<0.05 by chance alone (about 500 false positives). Using FDR or FWER adjustments reduces false positives.


### 10. ⚠️ Avoiding P-value Hacking and Reporting Negative Results

- **P-value hacking** is manipulating data or analysis methods to produce statistically significant results, often unintentionally.

- To avoid this, pre-specify your analysis plan before looking at the data and stick to it.

- Negative results (non-significant findings) are important to report to avoid **publication bias** and provide a complete scientific record.


### 11. 🔄 Confounding and Batch Effects in Experimental Design

- **Confounding** occurs when a third variable influences both the predictor and outcome, creating a false association.

- Example: Shoe size appears related to literacy, but age is the confounder because it affects both shoe size and literacy.

- In genomics, **batch effects** are a common confounder. For example, samples processed on different days or with different machines may show differences unrelated to biology.

- Studies have shown that batch effects can cause false discoveries, such as apparent gene expression differences between ethnic groups that disappear after adjusting for batch.

- **How to handle confounding:**
  - **Randomization:** Assign samples or treatments randomly to break associations with confounders.
  - **Stratification:** Design experiments to balance confounders across groups (e.g., equal numbers of males and females in treatment and control groups, samples processed on all days).

- Good experimental design includes balanced groups, replication, and controls to minimize confounding and batch effects.


### Summary

Statistics is a foundational pillar of genomic data science, essential for designing experiments, analyzing data, and drawing valid conclusions.
